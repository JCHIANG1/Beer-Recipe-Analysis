## Beer-Recipe-Analysis
The analysis is about how different factors associated with the last stage of the homebrewing process. The project is based on the linear regression model and a thorough process is carried out to test the linear assumptions and evaluate the hypothesis made for this project.

For the Part1 notebook the content mainly focuses on the background knowledge of beer homebrewing, the assumption made for this project, and how to preprocess the data. For the Part2 notebook, the full regression model is built and the linear regression model assumptions are evaluated. The Part3 notebook walks through the procedure to obtain the final model that yields the improvement in performance, to select the optimal model, and to interpret the model.

### Methodology
The Part1 Notebook
1. Data exploratory and cleaning
2. Handle the imbalanced data: Sampling
3. Split the data into training and testing set and standardized the predictors

The Part2 Notebook
1. Test assumptions and build a full model with all the x variables on the training set
2. Evaluate the baseline model performance on the testing set

The Part3 Notebok
1. Remove outliers and influential observations on the training set
2. Remove the high VIF variables on the training set and obtain the final model
3. Compare two sets of model performance on the testing set
4. The model interpretation and the conclusion
